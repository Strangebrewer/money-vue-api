Setup Transactions page

Setup delete functionality for all of these
Deleting a transaction is the only delete function that should should recalculate account balances (source, destination, etc);
   It should delete associated transactions, too, such as CC payments. i.e. it should delete the checking debit as well as the CC payment.

Deleting an account should delete all transactions on that account
   It should also remove all references to it in the user's account, in categories, monthlies, and as source or destination in any transactions. But, it should not recalculate any other balances.

Deleting a category or a monthly should remove any reference to it in transactions and in the user model.
   But, it should not recalculate any balances - it's just the removal of tracking markers, but does not negate the actual expense.



**I think most, maybe all, transactions are ironed out. We'll see if any other problems crop up...
